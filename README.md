Knowledge check for Module 1 - HTML/CSS

This simple website achieves the four required goals of the project. Each portion is labeled with comments.

The site was built using Bootstrap 5.

That is my crazy cat, Miss Mabel Mabel Not.

Challenges:

  The circular image didn't work originally because the picture was in portrait format. It turned into a vertical oval rather than a circle. I fixed this by making the image pretty much square using GIMP.

  The navbar did not open after it collapsed. I found this was because I was missing the script to add that functionality.

  The navbar overlapped the form using fixed-top, which I fixed by using sticky-top.
